DFK crawler fetches web pages and extracts data from them, according to some conditions. So that it can be stored in a database and manipulated as desired.

The actual use case can be grabbing list of products on several pages and follow each productâ€™s main page to retrieve additional information. The application returns information as a JSON, XML or CSV data.
