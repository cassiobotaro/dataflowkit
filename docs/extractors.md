# Extractor types

## text

text returns the combined text contents of the given selection.  

*params*

#### includeIfEmpty

 If text is empty in the selection, then return the empty string, instead of 'nil'.  This signals that the result of this Part should be included to the results, as opposed to omiting the empty string.
## multipleText

multipleText extracts the text from each part in the given selection and returns the texts as an array.  

*params*

#### includeIfEmpty

If there are no items in the selection, then return empty list, instead of the 'nil'.  This signals that the result of this Part should be included to the results, as opposed to omiting the empty list.

## html

html extracts and returns the HTML from inside each part of the given selection, as a string.  
i.e. if our selection consists of 

```
​```
[<p><b>ONE</b></p>,
 <p><i>TWO</i></p>]
​```
then the output will be:  
​```
<b>ONE</b><i>TWO</i>
​```  
```

The return type is a string of all the inner HTML joined together.

## outerHtml

outerHtml extracts and returns the HTML of each part of the given selection, as a string.  
If our selection consists of 

```
​```
["<div><b>ONE</b></div>", 
 "<p><i>TWO</i></p>"]
​```
then the output will be:
​```
"<div><b>ONE</b></div><p><i>TWO</i></p>"
​```  
```

The return type is a string of all the outer HTML joined together.

## attr

attr extracts the value of a given HTML attribute from each part in the selection, and returns them as a list.  
The return type of the extractor is a list of attribute values (i.e. ```[]string```).  

*params*

#### **attr**

The HTML attribute to extract from each part.

#### **alwaysReturnList**

By default, if there is only a single attribute extracted, the match itself will be returned (as opposed to an array containing the single match).  
Set alwaysReturnList to true to disable this behaviour, ensuring that the Extract function always returns an array.

#### **includeIfEmpty**

If no parts with this attribute are found, then return the empty list instead of  'nil'. This signals that the result of this Part should be included to the results, as opposed to omiting the empty list.

## link

link extracts ```attr="href"``` and text from specified field.

## image

image extracts ```attr="src"``` and ```attr="alt"``` from specified field.

## regex

regex runs the given regex over the contents of each part in the given selection, and, for each match, extracts the given subexpression.  
The return type of the extractor is a list of string matches (i.e. ```[]string```).  

*params*

#### regexp

The regular expression to match.  This regular expression must define exactly one parenthesized subexpression (sometimes known as a "capturing group"), which will be extracted.

#### subExpression

The subexpression of the regex to match.  If this value is not set, and if the given regex has more than one subexpression, an error will be thrown.

#### onlyText

When onlyText is true, only run the given regex over the text contents of each part in the selection, as opposed to the HTML contents.

#### alwaysReturnList

By default, if there is only a single match, Regex will return the match itself (as opposed to an array containing the single match).  

Set alwaysReturnList to true to disable this behaviour, ensuring that the Extract function always returns an array.

#### includeIfEmpty

If no matches of the provided regex could be extracted, then return the empty list, instead of 'nil'.  This signals that the result of this Part should be included to the results, as opposed to omiting the empty list.

## const

const returns a constant value.  

*params*  

#### value

The value to return.

## count

count extracts the count of parts that are matched and returns it.
